# Introduction
Similar to smart cities, a *smart campus* utilizes smart technologies to create new experiences and services. A smart campus helps universities to differentiate from their peers because it facilitates efficient practices and eliminates outdated transactional processes. Universities in particular serve as an ideal platform to showcase smart applications to promote smart campuses. These smart technologies, which are connected to the Internet and AI-driven – can improve various aspects of the student and faculty experience on campus such as:

- Improving student services
* Reducing wait times
- Reducing human errors
* Automating workflows
- Conserving energy and resources
* Network computing
- Finding the time, cost, and location of student events

## Project Aim: 


As smart cities are created rapidly, smart campuses are developing rapidly. Research in the smart campus area is still growing, where every researcher defines the concept of smart campus with a less thorough perspective that has not been conical in the same conception of the concept.[1] 
At universities worldwide, creating a ‘smart campus’ is gaining significance. This is a response to the increasingly dynamic use of the campus and the pressure on resources: energy, financial and human resources. The university community has become more mobile, student numbers more unpredictable and funding more uncertain. Consequently, campus strategies focus on resource efficiency and sharing space, requiring investment in management information to improve decision making. [2] 
Citizens of smart camous can benefit from a smart living environment, easy access to services, ubiquitous connectivity, intelligent decisions enabled by smart governance, and resource optimization. Similarly, smart campuses can provide the highest quality services to improve healthcare, energy usage, transportation, and education [3]

We present an interactive, online map of the Hacettepe University campus. The purpose of the Interactive Campus Map is to search for, navigate to, and retrieve information about features on campus. Interactive maps can be a great way of displaying useful information in an engaging and attractive way by inviting the user to take action.



## Project Goals:

The goal of the project is to provide the user with the location and current menu information of cafeterias and cafes within the scope of the Hacettepe University Smart Campus Project. 
The goal of the project is to provide the user with the location and current menu information of cafeterias and it also shows the route from the user's location to the cafeteria on the web page and also it has a height and weight index calculator within the scope of the Hacettepe University Smart Campus Project.

## Project Description

The interactive campus map of Hacettepe is a web-based application that can be accessed through a web browser. With the Leaflet Map Application Programming Interface, the availability of the overlay function has been taken advantage of to create custom map functionalities.

## Technologies Used:

- ### IDEs for coding
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Visual_Studio_Code_1.35_icon.svg/2048px-Visual_Studio_Code_1.35_icon.svg.png" alt="vscode" width="150" height="150"/></a> <br>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/PyCharm_Icon.svg" alt="py" width="150" height="150"/> 

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. JetBrains PyCharm is a Python IDE for data science and web development with intelligent code completion.
